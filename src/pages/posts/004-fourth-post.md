## How important is version control?

I first was introduced to github in 2011, prior to this I did what anyone would do, save every change to a seprate folder in my file explorer. Wow did that stink! Looking for the right file, figuring out what changed between versions... it was a mess. Since I didnt really do much of coding back then I could manage, but it was far from ideal going into 20 deep folders to find what I had attempted to organize. I began doing more work on android in 2013 again, to the point where i had to figure out github better but forgot my passwords so created a new account. would it be worth bringing in my old repos? at this point no, but i wish i did so i could look back on them better, just for nostalgia sake.

## How to begin the right way
If you're just starting out learn git and github right away, you will thank yourself later. So let's do it! first go to the docs [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), there are different methods for windows, mac and linux so choose the appropriate one. If you get stuck let me know otherwise lets run some tests.

Run this in your terminal

    git --version

If you get a response like < git version 2.27.0 > then you're good to go. 
Next setup an account on [github](https://github.com/) once that is complete we need to connect your local machine to your new online repository.
