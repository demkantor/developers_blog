## Is that how the saying goes?
CSS is one of those thechnologies that get's a bad wrap, somewhat justifiable but I would wager that most who dislike it never learned it or haven't kept up on it's progression. Just like with HTML many say CSS (cascading style sheets) is not a coding language, and often those are the same people who complain that it doesn't work for them. I'm here to tell you that, when learned early, CSS will be a powerful and fun tool that you'll enjoy using daily!

### You said somewhat justifiable...
So yes, the part that frustrates people that isn't about not understanding is about making your styles work in every browser... but here's the thing, that's not up to CSS, it is the browsers that need to stay up to date and support the latest technologies. But I will say that making sure what works properly in Firefox works in Chrome works in Safari and so on... is not a fun task, but in time you will learn tricks to add proper fallbacks and how to check for browser capability before you release a product.

## Ok, where to begin?
