The first code I ever wrote... thats a tough one as it's hard to say what consists of coding, but I would say it was somewhere around 2009 when I started playing with android. I've alway been interested in technology, from taking apart my toys to fins out how they work, to learning how to solder small lights to a power source it has always been something that gave me great happiness.

### Android
The HTC Dream, the Google G1, whatever name you want to give my first smart phone I was hooked to it. Within a few days of owning it I learned it could be rooted, and although I didn't really know what that meant I knew i wanted to do it! So I dug through forums and random websites until I was able to do it succesfully. I felt like some sort of big shot, but in reality I just followed other peoples guides and didn't really know what I did or why it worked! After I realized that I decided to figure that out. I dropped Windows and picked up Linux, I found IRC's with tons of awesome people who helped me and embraced the open source community.

### XDA developers
I slowly became active in internet forums myself, tried to find ways to give back by helping others just as others freely helped me. I was given the title of recogonized developer and have over 6000 posts 

**Happy Coding!**
