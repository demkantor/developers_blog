## Should JavaScript Be Your First Coding Langauge?
I Know, I know, CSS and HTML can be considered a scripting language but for the sake of not wanting to argue semantics lets ignore that debate. JavaScript on the other hand is absolutely a coding language and it is ubiquitous in the web. But what if you don't see yourself as a web developer, should you bother to learn it? I'd argue yes. Javascript is flexible, easy to read and easy to learn. It can be used on the client side (front-end) or as a server side (back-end) language thanks to node.js. So this means learning this one language can allow you to learn a large swath of skills that will be benifitial no matter your area of expeertise.
