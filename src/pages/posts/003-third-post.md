### What do I use as a computer?
Kind of a silly question but for some time this was important to me. Not so much the hardware but the operating system used. 

### The old me
There was a time I thought I needed to be an evangalist for open source, I likely also thought of myself as special for not using Windows or Mac, like I was a member of some cool kids club. But in reality I'm completely agnostic when it comes to what other people use and to a large degree what I use. Curently I run Ubuntu 20.04 on both my PC and laptop. The laptop is a dell xps 13 7390, so its small and ultra portable yet more than capable to do what I do. My PC is a hodgepoge of parts so I have no branding to it but outside of no fancy graphics card its super capable as well. But like I said, hardware was never my concern, it was the OS.

### GNU/Linux
So what was it that got me hooked on open source? Many things, I guess at first it was "sticking it to the man" or something silly like that. Then there was the free part, both free in monetary terms and free as in the freedom to customize. But what really set me up for life long linux fanboydom (is that a word?) was the community. Sure I found jerks that didn't want to help out a n0oB but for the most part found awesome amazing people willing to help complete strangers and get nothing in return. This was what called to me. I started with Ubuntu 10.04 then slowly started to test various other distros to see what was the best fit, best desktop enviroment etc. Is there a best one for me? Nope, I've enjoyed almost all the distros I've used, and will likely keep changin up every so often as I do love that freedom!

### Should you be using linux?
Not necessarily, you should use whatever fits your needs. If you have never tried any Linux distrobution or it has been a long time since you have I would suggest giving it a shot. Most of the time it is super easy to dual boot your computer with two OSs or run a virtual enviroment or even just use a USB stick with the complete OS on it! I learned so much from jumping ship from Windows and Mac that it's hard for me not to recomened you at least get your feet wet. But is it hard? Nope! even the distros like Arch that has a bad rap for install isn't super tough, and there all those communities I spoke about to help. Mostly installation is done in minutes and navigation takes little time to adjust to. In the end though, use what works best for you. And as always...

**Happy Coding!**
